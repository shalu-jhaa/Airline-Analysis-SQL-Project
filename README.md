# Airline-Analysis-SQL-Project
# ✈️ Airline Data Analysis – SQL + Python

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline booking and ticketing data using **SQL** and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**.  
The aim was to extract insights about **aircraft occupancy, seat utilization, and revenue performance** from multiple relational tables.

---


## 🔑 Key Analysis Performed
1. **Occupancy Rate Calculation**  
   - Avg. seats booked per aircraft  
   - Total seats vs. booked seats  
   - Occupancy rate (%)  

2. **Revenue Analysis**  
   - Total revenue generated per aircraft  
   - Revenue contribution of top aircraft types  
   - Incremented Turnover (10% growth scenario)  

3. **Visual Insights**  
   - Occupancy distribution across aircrafts  
   - Revenue share by aircraft type  
   - Time series of tickets booked  
   - Rolling average of daily tickets

Full dataset size is large, so only a small sample is included here for demonstration. Full dataset can be downloaded from  Kaggle or generated separately.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **SQL** – Data extraction & aggregation  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data cleaning, transformation & visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis & reporting environment  

---

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Average occupancy rate across aircrafts ~ **55–65%**  
- Top aircraft contributed **70%+ of revenue**  
- With a 10% growth scenario, total turnover increases significantly  
- Seasonal variations visible in ticket booking trends

## 📌 Conclusion
This project showcases how **SQL + Python** can be used together for **end-to-end data analytics**:  
from querying relational databases, calculating KPIs, generating insights, and producing visual dashboards.
